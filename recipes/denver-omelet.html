    <h1>The Denver Omelet</h1>
    <img src="../img/denver.webp" alt="">
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I 
        learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced smoked ham</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; 
            season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. 
            Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
        <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. 
            Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
    </ol>
